The solution to the HOPR puzzle #8, of 2021/2022.

A three person team had a great 'family time' doing battle with a really excellent puzzle, from late 2021 to early 2022, a puzzle with a 'purse' for the first to solve it. Which -- we did!

The details of the puzzle itself are here:

In this repository is the program which 'solved' the puzzle--- notice it is one of many revisions and sub-revisions that explored dead-ends.
And also the output of the program, to save folks the bother of running it.

It was a really fun diversion from 'the everyday' for all of us.
